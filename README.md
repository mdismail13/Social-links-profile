## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Inter)

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Center a card perfectly using CSS Grid (`place-items: center`)
- Use `:root` to manage color variables for easy theme customization
- Add transitions and `:hover`, `:active` effects smoothly
- Build reusable, clean button styles using shared classes

Hereâ€™s a simple code I liked:

```css
.card-btn:hover {
  background-color: var(--Green);
  color: var(--Grey-800);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Making my components more accessible with semantic HTML and `aria` attributes  
- Adding real links to each social media button (currently they are just buttons)  
- Adding a dark/light mode toggle using JavaScript and CSS variables  
- Making the design more dynamic using JavaScript (like profile data coming from JSON)  
- Improving responsiveness on very small screens (less than 320px)

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - Helped me understand how to center content using grid and manage layout effectively.
- [Google Fonts - Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Used to apply clean and modern typography to the design.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Source of this great challenge, also a great place to learn by doing real-world projects.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Very helpful for aligning and spacing elements inside the card.
